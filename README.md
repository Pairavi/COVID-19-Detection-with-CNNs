# COVID-19-Detection-with-CNNs

It aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for COVID-19 detection in lung CT scans. Custom CNN architectures are designed with normalization, dropout, and early stopping techniques to enhance accuracy and prevent overfitting. Additionally, pre-trained CNN models are fine-tuned using transfer learning.
